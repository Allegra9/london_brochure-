                London is the political, economic and cultural capital of Britain, 
                and its world class tourist attractions are renowned across the globe. The Greater London area is bursting with attractions for
                visitors of all ages. With 30 historic gardens and 123 historic buildings, London also has more than 200 museums, 600 cinema screens, and 108 music halls. London's 33 boroughs, including the City of London, are spread over an area of 1572 square kilometres
            </p>
            <p>
                The river Thames runs through the heart of London, from Richmond in the west, through the central London borough of Westminster, to Greenwich in the east. London river cruises and river buses are a great way to see the city.
            
                About one third of London is devoted to parks and open spaces, so there are plenty of places to relax on fine days.
            
                London is incredibly well-connected, with five international airports and the high-speed Eurostar rail link. More than 50 countries are within a three-hour flight time and 310 international destinations have direct links to London.
            </p>
            <h4>The London Eye</h4>
            <p>
                The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. Also known as the Millennium Wheel, it has also been called by its owners the British Airways London Eye, the Merlin Entertainments London Eye, the EDF Energy London Eye and, as of mid-January 2015, the Coca-Cola London Eye.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure is 443 feet (135 m) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 394 feet (120 m). When erected in 1999 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. Its height was surpassed by the 520 feet (158 m) tall Star of Nanchang in 2006, the 541 feet (165 m) tall Singapore Flyer in 2008, and the 550 feet (168 m) High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014. Supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the taller Nanchang and Singapore wheels, the Eye is described by its operators as "the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is Europe's tallest Ferris wheel, and offered the highest public viewing point in London until it was superseded by the 804 feet (245 m)  oservation deck on the 72nd floor of The Shard, which opened to the public on 1 February 2013. It is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3.75 million visitors annually, and has made many appearances in popular culture.
            <p class="dotted">
                The London Eye adjoins the western end of Jubilee Gardens (previously the site of the former Dome of Discovery), on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge, in the London Borough of Lambeth.

                        LONDON — Back in August, the Waitrose Good Food Guide 2017 published its ranking of the UK's 50 best restaurants. While the top three places to check out in the UK this year are in Cumbria, Cornwall, and Nottinghamshire, London is still the foodie capital of the country. Fifteen restaurants in the capital make it onto the list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best restaurant in the UK, according to the Good Food Guide is L’Enclume, located in a small Cumbrian village, but four London venues make it into the top 10. Many of them also have the most expensive tasting menus in the city. From regular award winner Le Gavroche in Mayfair, to the boundary-pushing menu at Restaurant Story in Bermondsey, here are the top 13, with their overall rankings in brackets.

                This unique concept makes M RAW (in the stunning, multifaceted Victoria venue), the first 100 per cent gluten-free restaurant in London to serve ‘Michelin quality food’. Featuring the worlds’ most ethically sourced and sustainable ike-jime (the most ethical and sustainable way to fish by paralyzing it) seafood and the purity of the finest raw ingredients, including sashimi from king fish to octopus and sea bass. The dedicated menu offers signature tartars, tempura, hot earth bowls and bento boxes. But the star of the show is undoubtedly the sashimi collection made using cobia – hailed as “the Wagyu of the sea” – where M RAW is among the first restaurants in the UK to feature the fish on its menus.

                Ceviche founder, Martin Morales, has opened Casita Andina on Soho's Great Windmill Street - a sister outpost to his Andina in Shoreditch – a restaurant dedicated to the superfood ingredients from the Peruvian Andes. Inspired by Peruvian ‘picanterias’ - the traditional family-friendly eateries found across Peru – it dishes up honest, home-style comfort food, which is entirely gluten free - using sustainable and organic ingredients. Some, like quinoa and maca, are flown over from Peru, while others are sourced from British farms.

            <h4 class="text-center">Paleo</h4>
            <p>
                Compared with other parts of the body, hair and nails are not essential to our survival. Thus, if you’re nutrient deficient or otherwise have compromised health, hair and nail quality will probably be the first to go. The overall nutrient density of a Paleo diet alone can lead to a significant improvement in hair and nail strength, thickness, and shine, but certain nutrients such as zinc, biotin, and iron may play a particularly important role, and it’s common for intakes of these nutrients to increase significantly when someone switches to a Paleo diet.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, red meat and shellfish are some of the best dietary sources of zinc, while cereal grains actually decrease zinc absorption due to the presence of phytates. Because of this, people who avoid red meat and shellfish and consume lots of whole grains (in other words, people who follow a conventionally “healthy” diet) might not be getting adequate zinc, which could lead to poor hair and nail quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dietary phytates also decrease iron absorption, and iron deficiency is a less well-known but significant contributor to hair loss, particularly for premenopausal women who have low iron stores but are not anemic. I’ve discussed before how increasing iron intake isn’t beneficial for everyone, but for a large percentage of women, the increased iron absorption resulting from more red meat and fewer whole grains on a Paleo diet could resolve hair loss and lead to thicker hair.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Egg yolks, like red meat, are often discouraged on a so-called “healthy” diet, but are allowed (and even encouraged) within a Paleo framework. Egg yolks also happen to be one of the most concentrated sources of biotin, which is extremely important for hair growth. Biotin is also important for nail health, and in one study, patients experienced a 25% increase in nail plate thickness from biotin supplementation.
            </p>
